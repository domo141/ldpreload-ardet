Selectively create deterministic ar archives and libraries
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

without D/-D/U/-U


GNU binutils ar and ranlib do not provide selective way to create
deterministic archive without using D and -D command line options
(respectively).

(Binutils can be configured with --enable-deterministic-archives, but
then the feature is on always by default. That may break some use
cases, and may cause confusion due to unexpected results.)

Just setting an environment variable to enable determinism would be
very useful feature.

But since we don't have such feature...

The LD_PRELOAD "library" ldpreload-ardet.so provides such a feature by
adding D to ar(1) argv[1] in one elf .init phase. In case of ranlib(1)
ldpreload-ardet.so has to re-exec the process in order to add extra
arguments to its execution.

Executing `sh ldpreload-ardet.c` will build `$PWD/ldpreload-ardet.so`.

Usage example: `LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/ldpreload-ardet.so ar example.ar *`

The ./ardet.pl command line utility can be used to post-process
already built ar archive to zero timestamp, uid and gid fields in it
i.e. restore determinism in those parts.

Checking whether ar or ranlib is run has some heuristics, in theory
this could break execution of other command that just happens to end
with -ar or -ranlib (but so far I have not seen such an executable).
